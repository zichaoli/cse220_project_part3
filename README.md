# cse220_project_part3

I use the same github repo but use a different workload. The workload for my part3 is https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus/blob/master/backtracking/n_queens_all_solution_optimised.cpp. The IPC is improved from 0.46 to 0.73. The number of instructions is 182998036.

I change the n from 4 to 100. The target of the workload is to solve the nqueens problem. The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Just run the run_total.sh
